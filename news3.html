				<p>You can ask Chat GPT anything. Open AI's enormously popular chatbot can dispense essays, songs, and website code with, albeit, varying degrees of success. But can it do the same with pet care advice?Not at all worried it's going to eventually take our jobs, we asked Chat GPT 12 questions on pet training, health, and behavior. Some were vague (What's the best way to train my dog?), some were controversial (Which breeds are best for novice dog owners?), and some were traps (Are pit bulls vicious?).</p>
				<p>Overall, Chat GPT offered decent insight but only scratched the surface on most topics. It can surely serve as a starting point for pet owners with questions, but speaking directly with a veterinarian or trainer will always be a much more valuable option."It's like a toddler," Leigh Seigfried, founder and training director at Opportunity Barks, tells Daily Paws. "It doesn't know a whole lot yet, but it's going to get better and learn more."</p>
				<p>It has begun to learn more, and in one case it's gleaned data from 1.5 million veterinary consultations to offer pet owners health advice.Generally speaking, Chat GPT—which is currently free to use—can offer insight to pet owners who don't want to spend time Googling or, as Cooper pointed out, don't have access to a trainer or veterinarian. It can be a starting point, as long as you recognize its limitations.Speaking of starting points, maybe you're wondering which dog breed is best for a first-time dog owner. We asked what Chat GPT thought.Like our advice, it listed golden retrievers and beagles among its five recommendations. Labrador retrievers, bulldogs, and poodles filled out the list, and that's where it gets iffy.</p>
				<p>Let's start with bulldogs. Chat GPT said they're known to be gentle, calm, and low-energy. That's generally true, but the chatbot doesn't mention how the brachycephalic breed is prone to a litany of health issues that can force a novice pet owner to spend plenty of time and money at the vet."I would never recommend a bulldog," Warr says. "It's challenging from a medical perspective to really recommend anyone buying them."Then you have poodles, which Chat GPT listed because they're smart, easy to train, and hypoallergenic. Well, they're as hypoallergenic as any dog can get, but I regret to report they don't prevent all allergy suffering. I can also confirm that these intelligent dogs can be a handful if you're just learning how to take care of a dog."How are you gonna handle that?" Warr says.</p>
				<p>When Chat GPT got its second chance to answer the question this week, it did remove bulldogs from the list, replacing them with Cavalier King Charles spaniels. The poodles remained.The question encapsulates how the tool can be useful while also still needing expert advice. Cooper, for instance, challenged the premise of the question, saying each dog is an individual and can't be classified only as a member of one breed.</p>
				<p>So it's useful for basic pet care questions or coming up with potty training plans. But all three experts agreed that it shouldn't be used for serious health, behavior, or safety concerns. That's when you need a real professional.And even if the bot's advice checks out, you still need to be careful trying it with your pet. Do you really want to try something out without a trainer's or veterinarian's guidance?</p>
				<p>"I've seen a massive rise in people f—ing it up, to be perfectly honest," Warr says. "They take the information they learn online and they just kind of mess up the application in a small way. And that's entirely normal, mistakes happen. The problem then comes when the mistakes happen with captive animals or children or other moral agents."</p>
