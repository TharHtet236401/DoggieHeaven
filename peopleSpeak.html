I am associated with all PFA Shelter of Yangon. I recommend Doggie Haven Dog Shelter. I chose Doggie Haven because they have trained staff and doctors, each dog is given personal care and attention. They have a high recovery rate most of my dogs come back healthy and happy. This is a very affordable and best shelter in today's era. In my final words I suggest everyone send their dogs for treatment in Doggie Haven.</p>

They have always said - send the baby to us. Very compassionate team and very organised too. They ensure every case is treated with utmost care and warmth. Keep up the good work.</p>

              <p class="card-text editText">My association with Doggie Haven began when my street dog Pudding was run over by a car. Pudding was 1 years old and unable to walk. While I was frantically looking for a shelter, I came across Doggie Haven. They aided her recovery through regular physiotherapy sessions. During my monthly visits to Doggie Haven, I developed a warm relationship with their staff, who are compassionate and driven. One could see the effort they put in to help the wounded and afflicted dogs. It’s wonderful that shelters like Doggie Haven exist.</p>

              <p class="card-text editText">After learning about Doggie Haven and its amazing efforts to offer dogs a safe haven from being poisoned, beaten or killed living in the streets of Yangon, I knew I wanted to volunteer there. At DH I spent most of my time loving on the dogs and attempting to learn all of their names. One day, a dog that I’d never seen before came right over and stood on my lap. He didn’t have a name because he’d been afraid of people for a long time. I started searching for him each time I came to visit, to make sure I gave him some attention and eventually, brought Kamran, my fiancé, to meet him. Shortly after, we began talking about adoption and bringing him back to the US when we relocated. A month later, we’d rented another apartment in Yangon where we could stay with Rambo. The entire DH team were so supportive throughout our preparation to bring Rambo back to the US. They followed up as soon as we’d landed to make sure that we were okay, and to let Kamran and I know how happy they were for us to all be together in our new home.
                He is such a great dog, and we are eternally grateful to DH for saving him, for loving him and for helping us to make sure he got home safe.</p>

            <p class="card-text editText">Just more than a year ago, my family agreed to foster a puppy from Doggie Haven. We eagerly awaited our new arrival, not sure of what these local dogs were like and what kind of pets they would make. A small black puppy arrived at our house, timid and thin with healing wounds on her face that led us to wonder about what kind of life she had led before she came to us. We heard that she had been very sick and that her mother and siblings died. The first night the puppy cried when she was left alone, but she felt comfortable sleeping near us. In the days that followed we worked hard to encourage her to eat, at first a huge challenge. Over time, with vitamins, food and love, she started to grow. Eventually it became clear that she wasn’t a foster puppy anymore, she was our dog and we would keep her.
                Our sickly little puppy turned into a fabulous dog called Zero, a funny name that came from her coat being “as black as a can of Coke Zero.” She enjoys life and after a day of play, she likes to curl up near your feet on the sofa and fall asleep, knowing she is safe and loved.</p>

              <p class="card-text editText">As soon as we moved to Myanmar, my son Gregory asked if we could have a dog. My husband and I had run out of excuses having moved into a house. We started our search for "our dog." When we heard about Izzy, she was a 1 year-old puppy that had been fostered by an Embassy family, and put in a loving home. However, her owners had to leave the country unexpectedly and everyone was trying to find Izzy a new home. We took Gregory to meet her...and it was love at first sight for both of them. They became family very quickly. Izzy plays soccer with Gregory and watches as he does his homework; Gregory gives her baths and many treats. Izzy has added even more joy to our lives, and has earned the love of a 6 year old, who now calls her "Izzy Darling."</p>
